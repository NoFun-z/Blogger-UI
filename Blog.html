                <p>As a quadruped robot, Spot can operate virtually anywhere a person can—going up and down stairs, indoors or outdoors, and through cramped or confined spaces.</p>
                <p>While this mobility can be impressive on its own, its real value is in automating sensing and inspection in areas inaccessible with wheeled or tracked robots and drones. You can send Spot into areas designed for people, that are unstructured, or even hazardous, to collect the data you need to understand what's going on in your facility or at your jobsite.</p><a class="Newslinks" href="https://blog.bostondynamics.com/unlock-the-data-that-matters-most" target="_blank">View more</a>

                <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is a word on everyone’s lips. Computing power and the sheer amount of data to be processed are growing exponentially. With AI, vast opportunities are opening up for performing tasks that used to require human intelligence in better, faster and more efficient ways.</p>
                <p>This can be good news for our planet, according to Kjell Reidar Mydske, the CEO of Smart Innovation Norway, which runs the specialised Cluster for Applied AI.</p><a class="Newslinks" href="https://www.theexplorer.no/stories/technology/this-is-how-norway-puts-artificial-intelligence-to-use/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAweaNBhDEARIsAJ5hwbcLkemcYT3WL0oEdIXssL16exvafaQkP8izhqqOdQECvlxH6XvFF9MaAjgsEALw_wcB" target="_blank">View more</a>

                <p>AI, or artificial intelligence, seems to be on the tip of everyone’s tongue these days. While I’ve been aware of this major trend in tech development for a while, I’ve noticed AI appearing more and more as one of the most in-demand areas of expertise for job seekers.</p>
                <p>In reality, AI is already at work all around us, impacting everything from our search results, to our online dating prospects, to the way we shop. Data shows that the use of AI in many sectors of business has grown by 270% over the last four years.</p><a class="Newslinks" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ashleystahl/2021/03/10/how-ai-will-impact-the-future-of-work-and-life/?sh=23fd504f79a3" target="_blank">View more</a>
