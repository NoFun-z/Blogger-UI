                <p>Both virtual assistants such as Siri and virtual influencers like Miquela or FN Meka have become popular in the 21st century as signs of technological innovation. However, this is the first time we’ve seen a classic cell phone carrier AI like Siri or Bixby reimagined as a virtual human.</p>
                <p>Samsung Sam’s viral success illustrates people’s desire for more virtual humans, even fully branded ones. Now, people are even speculating whether or not Sam could replace Samsung’s current AI assistant, the faceless and forgettable Bixby.</p>
                <p>While Sam may not be a confirmed creation of Samsung (yet!), Samsung has a long history of innovating in the virtual influencer space. In 2019, Samsung partnered with Brud’s Lil Miquela for a multi-month #TeamGalaxy campaign, placing their latest Galaxy phone in the coveted mirror-selfie spot of the Miquela storyline.</p>
